* Does it route directly peer to peer? If so then, when?
* Does it create a mesh?
* Does it isolate groups of clients/servers?
* Does it filter access to ports based on the origin?

## Setup Notes
Think tasting notes but for server and client setup. Was it easy? Was it hard? What did you get stuck on?

## Performance
Think tasting notes but for performance. This can include system resource usage in addition to network performance.

### Speed

* High latency?
* Dropped packets?
